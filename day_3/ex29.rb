## Study drill
# 1. so basically runs a check on the variables and if it passes the conditions it puts or runs whatever is under it
# 2. I think it indents to show its a part of the if statement
# 3. it still runs but its not aesthetically pleasing and its easier to see and understand when indented
# 4. you can it just changes the true or false it runs
# 5. It changes the statements that get put out if the initial values are covered in new conditions.
